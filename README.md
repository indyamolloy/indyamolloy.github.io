# Frida Kahlo Tribute Page

### My Topic:

I chose to write a tribute page about the Mexican artist **Frida Kahlo**. I chose to write about her because of her fascinating life and the hardships she experienced during it. Frida Kahlo is a symbol of feminism, strength and empowerment which is why I dedicated the tribute page to her.

### What I learned Making It:

While making this tribute page I learned how to use html and CSS together to write and style a piece of writing. I learned how to:

[x] Add images to webpages and use CSS to align them

[x] Link to other websites

[x] List items on a webpage

[x] Use margins to style the page

[x] Use ID selectors to style the webpage
